The insert(key) method takes a key as an argument and adds it to the end of the data array, then it compares the key with its parent node, if the parent node is greater than the new key, it swaps the two elements and continues the process until it reaches the root or the parent is less than the new key. This process ensures that the new key is placed in the correct position in the tree to maintain the min-heap property.

The delMin() method removes the minimum element from the priority queue, which is the root of the tree. It replaces the root with the last element in the data array and then compares the new root with its left and right children. If the left or right child is smaller than the new root, it swaps the new root with the smaller child, and continues the process until the new root is in the correct position to maintain the min-heap property. This method returns the minimum value removed from the priority queue.
